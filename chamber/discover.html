            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The earliest inhabitants of Cameroon were likely the Bakas (pygmies). They still inhabit the forests
                of the south and east provinces. Bantu speakers originating in the Cameroonian highlands were among
                the first groups to move out before other invaders. During the late 1770s and early 1800s, the
                Fulaniâ€”a pastoral Islamic people of the western Sahelâ€”conquered most of what is now northern
                Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The outpost of Epsumb or Jeundo was founded between the Nyong and Sanaga rivers at the northern edge
                of the area's forests in 1887,[4] 1888,[5][6] or February 1889 by the German explorers Lt. Richard
                Kund and Hans Tappenbeck by the agreement of the chiefs of Ela Esono.[8] From December 1889 to May
                1895, it was occupied by the German botanist Georg August Zenker as an agricultural research station
                named Jaunde after the local Yaunde or Ewondo people.[9] His settlement served as a base for the
                area's rubber and ivory trade, purchasing these from the natives in exchange for imported clothing
                and iron.[6] It was also known in English as Yaunde Station. Major Dominik's establishment of a
                military garrison at the site in 1895 permitted a Pallotine mission and religious school at nearby
                MvolyÃ© (now a suburb).
            </p><br>
            <p>
                During World War I, Jaunde was occupied by Belgian troops from the Congo. After Imperial Germany's
                defeat in that war, France held eastern Cameroon as a mandate of the League of Nations and YaoundÃ©
                was chosen to become the capital of the colony in 1922.[3] Douala long remained the more important
                settlement, but YaoundÃ© saw rapid growth after 1957 due to the cocoa crisis and unrest along the
                coast. It continued as the seat of government for the Republic of Cameroon upon its independence.

            <h2>Economy</h2>

            <p>
                Most of YaoundÃ©'s economy is centred on the administrative structure of the civil service and the
                diplomatic services. Owing to these high-profile central structures, Yaounde has a higher standard
                of living and security than the rest of Cameroon.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Major industries in YaoundÃ© include tobacco, dairy products, beer, clay, glass goods and timber. It
                is also a regional distribution centre for coffee, cocoa, copra, sugar cane and rubber.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Local residents engage in urban agriculture. The city is estimated to have "50,000 pigs and over a
                million chickens."
            </p><br>
            <p>
                According to YaoundÃ© City Council data, over 130 floods struck the city between 1980 and 2014, causing
                massive loss of life and economic damage. However, there has been a reduction of flooding in the city
                since the establishment of a sanitation master plan to address the issue.[13] Another measure was to
                relocate people living along the drainage routes and in low-lying flood zones.

            <h2>demographics</h2>

            <p>
                YaoundÃ© is the capital of Cameroon and, with a population of more than 2.8 million, the second-largest
                city in the country after the port city Douala. It lies in the Centre Region of the nation at an
                elevation of about 750 metres (2,500 ft) above sea level.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                The Centre Region (French: rÃ©gion du Centre) occupies 69,000 km2 of the central plains of the Republic
                of Cameroon. It is bordered to the north by the Adamawa Region, to the south by the South Region, to the
                east by the East Region, and to the West by the Littoral and West Regions. It is the second largest
                (after East Region) of Cameroon's regions in land area. Major ethnic groups include the Bassa, Ewondo,
                and Vute.
